# Train Network Simulation

This project aims to create a train network simulation based on the city of Berlin. It will include S-Bahn and U-Bahn lines, use the real station names and will simulate different trains driving along their respected lines.

The network is currently visualized by a simple browser implementation at your localhost on port 5934.

## OPACA Integration

In the future, this project will provide different services and functions to control various components of the network, such as switches, signals, direct orders to the trains and more. These services will be provided through a dispatcher agent, complying with the [OPACA Framework](https://github.com/GT-ARC/opaca-core).
